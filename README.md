KinectTest
==========

This is a project for me to learn the fundamentals of programming for the kinect. I am using a Xbox 360 kinect, and im developing with the Kinect SDK v1.8

THis program does not have any exceptions handles or way to handle errors. I do feel that this is a great learning tool for
anyone who is wanting to learn how to program for the kinect because it is basically the "bare bones" of what you 
need to do to get basic kinect functionality. However, there is basically no real use for this program other than for learning. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. 
Hopefully I will be starting on the real project soon.
